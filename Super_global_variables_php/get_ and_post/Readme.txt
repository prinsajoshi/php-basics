#Key Differences Between $_POST and $_GET

Data Location
POST: Data is sent in the request body.
GET: Data is appended to the URL as query parameters.

Data Size
POST: Suitable for larger amounts of data with no practical size limit.
GET: Limited by URL length constraints, typically around 2048 characters.

Data Visibility
POST: Data is not visible in the URL, making it better for sensitive information.
GET: Data is visible in the URL, making it less secure for sensitive data.

Data Usage
POST: Generally used for form submissions, file uploads, and actions that change server state.
GET: Used for retrieving and displaying information, query strings, and non-sensitive data.

Security
POST: More secure for transmitting sensitive data, though still needs proper security measures (e.g., HTTPS).
GET: Less secure for sensitive information due to data visibility in the URL.
