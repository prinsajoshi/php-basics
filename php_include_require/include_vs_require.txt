// include_example.php
include 'somefile.php'; // If 'somefile.php' is not found, the script will continue

// require_example.php
require 'somefile.php'; // If 'somefile.php' is not found, the script will halt

Both include_once and require_once are similar to include and require, respectively, but they ensure that the file is included only once during the script execution, avoiding potential issues with multiple inclusions.
