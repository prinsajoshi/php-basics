Join Condition:
Inner Join: Requires you to explicitly specify the join condition.
Natural Join: Automatically joins based on columns with the same name.

Flexibility:
Inner Join: More flexible as you can specify any columns for the join condition.
Natural Join: Less flexible as it only joins on columns with the same name and data type.

Column Matching:
Inner Join: Can join on columns with different names using aliases or explicit conditions.
Natural Join: Joins on columns with the same name; if there are multiple columns with the same name, all such columns are used for the join.

Readability:
Inner Join: Requires explicit conditions, which can make the query more readable and understandable.
Natural Join: Can be less clear, especially if multiple columns with the same name exist, making it harder to understand which columns are used for joining.
